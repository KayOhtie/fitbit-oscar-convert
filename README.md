# fitbit-oscar-convert

Fork of existing fitbit-convert script from a Google Drive link. Originally created by user 'ExtremeDeepSleep' [on the Apnea Board forums](https://www.apneaboard.com/forums/Thread-Fitbit-import-to-OSCAR).

Notable changes include:

- Optional start/end date arguments for range of data to process
- Export path defaults to 'export' in current directory but can be specified
- Logging with verbosity levels, optionally log to file
- Fixes for sleep data processing with changes in level names
